Weka Linear Regression Model Analysis

Number of Terms in the Model:
Our linear regression model resulted in a total of 13 terms, which includes 12 attributes and the intercept (constant term). Notably, the model does not include coefficients for the 'INDUS' and 'AGE' attributes. This absence suggests that these variables were not statistically significant contributors to the model within the dataset used, possibly due to a low R-squared contribution in relation to the dependent variable, which is the median value of owner-occupied homes.

Interpretation of Attribute Weights:

    CRIM: The negative coefficient for per capita crime rate indicates an inverse relationship with the median home value; as crime rate increases, the home value tends to decrease.
    ZN: The positive coefficient here shows that larger lot sizes are associated with higher home values.
    CHAS: Proximity to the Charles River (denoted by CHAS) carries a positive weight, implying a premium on river-adjacent properties.
    RM: A positive coefficient for the average number of rooms per dwelling suggests that larger homes correlate with higher median values.

Rationale for Exclusion of Attributes:

The model generated by Weka does not include 'INDUS' and 'AGE'. It is a common practice for automated modeling tools like Weka to eliminate attributes that do not significantly contribute to the predictive power of the model. In our case, the likely rationale for the exclusion of 'INDUS' and 'AGE' is their low statistical significance, which could be due to a smaller R-squared value meaning that they do not contribute as much variance to the median home value when compared to other variables.

Conclusion:

The provided linear regression model gives an insight into the relationship between various housing attributes and the median value of homes. The model indicates that factors such as crime rate, the presence of large residential lots, and the number of rooms have a more pronounced effect on housing prices, while the age of the property and the proportion of industrial land use in the area may be less important. This model serves as a predictive tool to estimate the median value of houses in the Boston area, based on the given dataset attributes.
